In the scope of an Interdisciplinary Project at the Technical University of Munich, an international, extendable corporate bonds database had to be built up from scratch for future empirical research. For this purpose, an automatic extraction tool for financial securities data has been developed on top of the interface provided by the Refinitiv Datastream financial database. The required static and time series corporate bond data -- consisting of over 60.000 bonds -- has been downloaded, cleaned, and prepared for further research. Additionally, a matching algorithm has been developed to join corporate bond and stock data based on their issuing company. The algorithm utilizes fuzzy string matching based on company name as well as key-based matching based on the CUSIP-9 parameter, and has shown a matching ratio of around 45\% without a globally unique company identifier. Further, the distribution of corporate bond returns has been found in-line with expectations, which served as a sanity check for the downloaded data. Finally, correlation and regression analyses have shown stock data to be more efficient in incorporating new information than corporate bond data based on a 1-month lead.
