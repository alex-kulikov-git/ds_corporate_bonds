abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is a flexible operating system for permissioned blockchains designed for business applications beyond the basic digital coin addressed by Bitcoin and other existing networks. A key property of this system is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. However, version 1 was launched in 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for this system on top of the BFT-SMART state machine replication/consensus library, with optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that our ordering service can process up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread across different continents.},

@article{Androulaki2018,
abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

@article{Yamashita2019,
abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, and it is the technology underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.},

abstract = {Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol, and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.},

abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) of Things has gathered interest among the Internet-of-Things (IoT) research community due to its hassle-free deployment and configurability. This approach to interconnecting devices provides the network with additional information about the data transported, which can be used for improved efficiency. This is one of the targets for mass IoT or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications modes of 5G. In this paper, we propose a context based forwarding strategy that makes forwarding decisions based on the tolerance to inaccuracies in data defined for the application requesting it. We also propose a modification to the hierarchical naming scheme by appending the name of the application generating the interest. In addition to faster context based forwarding, this modification simplifies the naming as it is easier to understand the context under which the interest was generated even with generic names. We demonstrate an improvement in energy efficiency of the system using the proposed technique compared to an IP based implementation. In addition, the proposed technique offers a platform to implement application level access control and Quality-of-Service support.},

abstract = {The rise in popularity of permissioned blockchain platforms in recent time is significant. Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Fabric comprises various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers, validators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major concern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and identify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of the system. We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size, endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the transaction throughput {\&} latency to provide various guidelines on configuring these parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2) sequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state validation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks. In the second phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our observations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography component (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement policy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the effect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state validation {\&} commit phase (2.5x improvement). By combining all three optimizations1, we improved the overall throughput by 16x (i.e., from 140 tps to 2250 tps).},

abstract = {Blockchain is a key technology that has the potential to decentralize the way we store, share, and manage information and data. One of the more recent blockchain platforms that has emerged is Hyperledger Fabric, an open source, permissioned blockchain that was introduced by IBM, first as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, and then more recently, in 2017, IBM released Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. Although there are many blockchain platforms, there is no clear methodology for evaluating and assessing the different blockchain platforms in terms of their various aspects, such as performance, security, and scalability. In addition, the new version ofHyperledger Fabric was never evaluated against any other blockchain platform. In this paper, we will first conduct a performance analysis ofthe two versions ofHyperledger Fabric, v0.6 and v1.0. The performance evaluation ofthe two platforms will be assessed in terms of execution time, latency, and throughput, by varying the workload in each platform up to 10,000 transactions. Second, we will analyze the scalability of the two platforms by varying the number of nodes up to 20 nodes in each platform. Overall, the performance analysis results across all evaluation metrics, scalability, throughput, execution time, and latency, demonstrate that Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 consistentlyoutperformsHyperledger Fabric v0.6.However, Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platformperformance did not reach the performance level in current traditional database systems under high workload scenarios.},

abstract = {Background: Digital health technologies, including telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and remote monitoring, are playing a greater role in medical practice. Safe and accurate management of medical information leads to the advancement of digital health, which in turn results in a number of beneficial effects. Furthermore, mHealth can help lower costs by facilitating the delivery of care and connecting people to their health care providers. Mobile apps help empower patients and health care providers to proactively address medical conditions through near real-time monitoring and treatment, regardless of the location of the patient or the health care provider. Additionally, mHealth data are stored in servers, and consequently, data management that prevents all forms of manipulation is crucial for both medical practice and clinical trials. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a tamper-resistant mHealth system using blockchain technology, which enables trusted and auditable computing using a decentralized network. Methods: We developed an mHealth system for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using a smartphone app. The volunteer data collected with the app were stored in JavaScript Object Notation format and sent to the blockchain network. Thereafter, we evaluated the tamper resistance of the data against the inconsistencies caused by artificial faults. Results: Electronic medical records collected using smartphones were successfully sent to a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. We verified the data update process under conditions where all the validating peers were running normally. The mHealth data were successfully updated under network faults. We further ensured that any electronic health record registered to the blockchain network was resistant to tampering and revision. The mHealth data update was compatible with tamper resistance in the blockchain network. Conclusions: Blockchain serves as a tamperproof system for mHealth. Combining mHealth with blockchain technology may provide a novel solution that enables both accessibility and data transparency without a third party such as a contract research organization.},

However, the most serious issues of collaborative business processes remained unsolved in these studies-lack of trust and divided data on various confidential ledgers. Blockchain technology has enormous potential to become a new substantial integration method for untrusted collaborative businesses. Using the governing consensus mechanism, blockchain eliminates the necessity of the trusted third party. It provides a distributed shared ledger which facilitates the job of the process monitoring for the parties. The smart contract, as a crucial tool, is used to define the guaranteed autonomous programs. In addition, the privacy of the data can be ensured by using a permissioned blockchain that handles the access control because, in this way, only verifiable participants can have access to the state of the business process and its related information. In this study, the applicability of execution of a real-world untrusted business process on the permissioned blockchain is investigated. Moreover, we determine the advantages of using the permissioned access-controller blockchain as the infrastructure for the collaborative business processes, through implementing the process of Order Processing on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.},

abstract = {When a database is replicated at many sites, maintaining mutual consistency among the sites in the face of updates is a significant problem. This paper describes several randomized algorithms for distributing updates and driving the replicas toward consistency. The algorithms are very simple and require few guarantees from the underlying communication system, yet they ensure that, the effect of every update is eventually reflected in all replicas. The cost and performance of the algorithms are tuned by choosing appropriate distributions in the randomization step. The algorithms are closely analogous to epidemics, and the epidemiology literature AIDS in understanding their behavior. One of the algorithms has been implemented in the Clearinghouse servers of the Xerox Corporate Internet, solving long-standing problems of high traffic and database inconsistency.},

abstract = {Most enterprise blockchain applications rely on real world trust relationship such as the business in financial institutions, entertainment industry, supply chain industry, transportation, education, healthcare services, etc. Hyperledger aims to advance blockchain technology that confederate in the cross-industry to open standard platform for distributed ledgers, which can transform the way business transactions are controlled globally. As we know currently the model of blockchain have permissionless blockchain and permissioned blockchain, which the permissionless blockchain such as Bitcoin cryptocurrency that anyone can operate a node and participate through spending CPU cycle and demonstrating a proof of work. On the other hand, permissioned blockchain model control who participates in validation and in the protocol. More over these nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium. Therefore, to make the innovation application that need the authority and permission for submitting the transaction we will select the hyperledger fabric framework to develop our project. Hence this paper will focus to study to develop a prototype of healthcare service application in dental clinic service. In order to keep records transactions that are accessible and controlled the authority by participants which it has a transaction id number that generate by hash number mechanism running by hyperledger composer. This application will create a trust relationship wherein the goal is to set up a set of participants in an ecosystem that it needed in health care service in the field of sharing the medical equipment and transaction that can save a variety of costs and make an interoperability process in the clinics.},

@article{Dinh2017,
abstract = {Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and componentwise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.},

abstract = {Blockchain has become one of the most attractive technologies for applications, with a large range of deployments such as production, economy, or banking. Under the hood, Blockchain technology is a type of distributed database that supports untrusted parties. In this paper we focus Hyperledger Fabric, the first blockchain in the market tailored for a private environment, allowing businesses to create a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric implements a PBFT consensus in order to maintain a non forking blockchain at the application level. We deployed this framework over an area network between France and Germany in order to evaluate its performance when potentially large network delays are observed. Overall we found that when network delay increases significantly (i.e. up to 3.5 seconds at network layer between two clouds), we observed that the blocks added to our blockchain had up to 134 seconds offset after 100 th block from one cloud to another. Thus by delaying block propagation, we demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric does not provide sufficient consistency guaranties to be deployed in critical environments. Our work, is the fist to evidence the negative impact of network delays on a PBFT-based blockchain.},

abstract = {Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we re-architect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3,000 to 20,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.},
