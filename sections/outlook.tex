\subsection{Outlook}
Within the scope of this seminar, we introduced a first prototype that could make large-scale building projects more transparent and effective. To advance the development of the proposed system, the implementation could be improved by connecting the Fabric network to a graphical user interface to increase the usability. 
Also, at the moment, the prototype stores \textit{hashes} of legal agreements in the blockchain network. In subsequent work, we believe that it would be more efficient to set up an adjacent database in which these hashes are mapped to digital copies of the corresponding legal agreements. 
In addition, it could also be interesting to exploit the event services of Hyperledger Fabric and issue and react to events if e.g. a contract is created by a certain entity. Lastly, the network should be tested in terms of performance and privacy.
