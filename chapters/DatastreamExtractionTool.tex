\chapter{Datastream Extraction Tool} \label{chapter:datastream-extraction-tool}
In order to draw any conclusions regarding the relationship of bond and stock returns, the respective static and time series data needs to be acquired first. Since equity data is already available from the beginning of the IDP, the bond data is the only one which had to be acquired. For bond data extraction, the financial database product Datastream, provided by Thomson Reuters, can be used, since it is licensed for usage by TUM students and employees. 

\section{Download Solution} \label{section:}
As Thomson Reuters has a wide range of products which can be used for different types of data, the first thing that needed to be done, was to determine the most suitable product to download both static and time series data for corporate bonds. After some time spent reading up and gathering information on the Thomson Reuters product portfolio, it became apparent that some of the products, such as the TR Python API, are only suitable for equity data download, and not for corporate bonds, and only have a very limited number of parameters available for download. On the other hand, it was found that other Thomson Reuters products, which would normally be suitable for automated download of bond data, such as e.g. DataScope Select (DSS) or Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH), are not included in the existing academic license. Other products -- noticeably the Datastream Web Service (DSWS) API, which is most suited for such requests -- are generally not available for academic clients. 

These findings were a significant setback for the bond data extraction, since the only option left to acquire large amounts of corporate bond data, was over the Datastream Add-In for Microsoft Excel. While this add-in is rather convenient for small-scale manual requests with the help of so-called request tables, it is not optimized for large data extraction queries.
