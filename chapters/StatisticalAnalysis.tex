\chapter{Statistical Analysis} \label{chapter:statistical-analysis}
The following chapter first explains the setup behind the conducted tests. After that, the performance of the parallelized algorithms is measured and compared to their respective non-parallelized versions. The algorithms in test are Naive-Nested-Loops, Block-Nested-Loops, Divide-and-Conquer, ST-S and SARTS.
