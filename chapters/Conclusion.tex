To conclude the presented work, a brief summary of the results as well as an outlook to future research will be provided. 

\section{Summary}
In the scope of the Interdisciplinary Project on the topic \textit{Leads and Lags of Corporate Bonds and Stocks}, a data extraction tool tailored to the interface of the Refinitiv Datastream product has been developed. It allows the user to conveniently enter request details for the desired financial data and to download it with significantly lesser overhead than manually via request tables. To prepare the downloaded data for future usage, a comprehensive formatting and cleaning procedure has been developed and documented. In order to make the extracted bond data comparable with equities, a matching algorithm based on the fuzzy string matching and the CUSIP-6 approaches has been derived, and can be extended to further use cases. Finally, a brief statistical analysis of the extracted data, in particular of calculated corporate bond returns has been conducted, and found to be in-line with widely accepted assumptions of the underlying statistical distributions. A basic analysis of the lead and lag relationships between corporate bond and stock returns has produced statistically significant results, according to which stock returns are faster in incorporating new information, and thus predict future corporate bond returns in the case of high-yield bonds.
