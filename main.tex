\begin{abstract}
Modern Blockchain technologies offer high potential to ensure transparency and security for transactions of money and goods among business partners. The aim of this work is to elaborate on the history, potential use cases and the technical properties of Hyperledger Fabric as an open-source project. Additionally, we propose a prototype implementation of a blockchain-based legal agreements storage built on top of Hyperledger Fabric. In particular, the suggested approach allows for the convenient supervision of cashflow within large-scale projects as well as the detection of potential cash leaks and criminal activity. In this work, we explain the motivation behind the suggested application as well as the real-life impact it can provide in projects with high expenditure. In this documentation, we present our implementation approach, encountered issues during setup and want to conclude with an outlook on Hyperledger Fabric and on our project in particular.
